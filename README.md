This is a mod, that causes entities wearing heavy armors to gain a brief slowness debuff, when hurt.

Entities with more than 10 armor gain slowness I, entities with 15 or more armor gain slowness II and entities with 20 armor gain slowness III.
Base duration of the slowness is 1s and it gets increased by 0.5s per 4 points of armor toughness.
